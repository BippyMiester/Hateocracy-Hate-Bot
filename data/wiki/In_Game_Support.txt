In-Game Support Tickets
A Support button has been added to the in-game Settings menu. Ticket submissions automatically include your player ID and account linked email, after which you can select your issue type and provide a subject and description. Once the ticket is submitted, you will see a ticket number in-game, which can also be found in your email inbox.
