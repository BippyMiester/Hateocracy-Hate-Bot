Enemy Details
Description
Enemies are the other entities in the game that try to attack your
Tower
. There are multiple different kinds of enemies that try to kill you.
Different Enemies
In the game there are 4 categories of enemies: Normal, Elite, Fleet and Boss. The max spawn cap at any one moment is 150 comprised of caps of 120 Normal enemies, 20 elites, and 10 bosses. Fleet Enemies occupy the Normal enemy spawn cap.
Shared characteristics
Enemies gain 4% more damage per hit(Heat-up Mechanic)
Enemies Lose 50% of their coin value if they are alive for more than 3 waves(Coin decay Mechanic)
Enemy Mass increases by 4% each wave they are alive
Normal Enemies
Normal enemies include Basic, Fast, Range, Tank and Protector. These enemies are in a single group and their chance to spawn in a wave will add to 100% for each wave.
Protectors have special spawn rules with only 1 per wave and a cooldown between the next chance to spawn. There is a limit of 8 at once.
Bosses
Bosses have a 0% spawn rate on normal waves and 100% on boss waves. Boss waves are every 10 waves except when a battle condition reduces the waves. Bosses are immune to
Orbs
(Excluding Boss Orb Hit Lab),
Death Ray
Shockwave
and
Black Hole
. Bosses drop module shards and reroll shards which are further increased after researching the appropriate
module-based labs
Elite Enemies
Elite enemies include Vampire, Ray and Scatter. There is a limit of only 1 spawn per wave or up to 2 at higher waves. All Elite enemies are immune to Orbs, Death Ray, Shockwave and Black Hole. Elite enemies will drop
Elite Cells
when defeated. The on screen Limit per Elite type is 8. Scatter children do not count towards this limit.
Elite enemies share a total % spawn split between the 3 types, the spawn % are: 1%, 4%, 9%, 16%, 25%, 36%, 49%, 64%, 81% and 100%.  The table below shows the percent per elite as shown in game. There is a hidden 0.33 repeating when the value is not divisible by 3.
The displayed chance jumps from 33% to 100% once the background chance for a second elite per wave also reaches 100%. Meaning if the chance says 33%, you’re guaranteed at least one, possibly two elites per wave. If it says 100%, you’re guaranteed two elite per wave.
Single Elite Enemy spawns
Table below shows the rate when 1 elite enemy can spawn.

Fleet Enemies
Disclaimer:
Much of this portion is derived from Developer Notes given to me. There are still things in V27 that may have been implemented differently than stated below, or Bugs affecting intended behavior. Time will allow for these differences to be distinguished.
Fleet Enemies include Saboteur, Commander, and Overcharge and can be encountered on T14 and beyond. Fleet enemies are Immune to Orbs, Death Ray, shockwave, knockback,  Black Hole Damage, and Black Hole Pull. They have 90% resistance to Thorns and 50% resistance to Chrono Field, Chrono Loop(CF+), Thunder bot, Poison Swamp Stun, Land Mine Stun, and Inner Land Mine Stun. The Magnetic Hook module and Plasma cannon card cannot target fleet enemies. Fleet enemies do not collide with other enemies. Commander and Overcharge reach their range outside of tower range while the saboteur will fully approach the tower.

Fleet Enemy Spawns
Fleet enemies will always spawn when they should. Wave skipping a wave where a Fleet Enemy would spawn will spawn the fleet enemy. Fleet enemies spawn with a group of their related enemies. The count of spawned enemies appears to be a random number in the 10-14 range. Fleet spawn time is random within the wave it will spawn. If the enemy spawn count is capped, a related enemy will despawn to allow the fleet to spawn. The related enemy is fast for Saboteur, Tank for Commander, and Ranged for Overcharge.
Fleets at Higher Waves on Lower Tiers
Fleets have been added to all tiers. Tier 1 will have Fleets starting at wave 15,000, and each subsequent tier will have Fleets appear 250 waves earlier (T2 = 14,750, T3 = 14,500, etc). Once they appear, they will spawn every 100 waves.
