Modules
Current Modules. (As of v27) Credits to @NanaSeiYuri
There are 4 types of modules:
Cannon: Focuses on
Attack
Armor: Focuses on
Defense
Generator: Focuses on
Utility
Core: Focuses on
Ultimate Weapons
Acquiring Modules
Modules are unlocked by reaching Tier 2 wave 90. Modules can be acquired using module tickets or gems. 10 module tickets are given for free when modules are first unlocked. Earning more tickets is not yet determined. You can buy modules with gems at x1 draw for 20 gems or x10 draws for 200 gems. There are 2 "Banners" you can select to buy modules from. The standard banner will allow "normal" chances of drawing each epic. Modules owned that are 5* Anc are less likely to be pulled. A featured banner will showcase a specific module that will have a subset chance of 50% of epic pulls being that specific module. Distributions of epic pull rates can be viewed within each banner to see how pull rates are affected. Featured banners have a two week duration followed by a one week break.
Purchased modules are randomly assigned 1 of 3 rarities: Common, Rare and Epic. The rates are shown below:
Common module - 68.5%
Rare Module - 29%
Epic Module - 2.5%
With bad luck protection, if you don't get an epic Module for 150 purchases, you're guaranteed an Epic Module.  Additionally, It is guaranteed to have at least 1 rare module in every 10-pull.
Upgrading Modules
Modules can be leveled up to improve their main stat using shards and coins. The maximum level of a module is determined by its current rarity. By merging modules to higher rarities, you can increase the module to its new max. Merging will not reset the current level of the module.

Shards can be earned from shattering modules at a rate of 5 per common and 10 per rare (after merging, the shards earned from shattering keep the value of all merged modules combined), completing daily events, and buying them from the
event shop
. Natural epics may be shattered once a 5-star Ancestral Mod is formed of the same type.
Modules can be reset by using the "restore" button. The button does not cost resources and will return all shards spent and all coins spent. Reroll shards and gems are not returned. All sub-module effects will be kept until the module is levelled again, even those that require higher levels, so there is no harm in having several modules with different effects that you swap levels between.
Boss Drops
Bosses can drop reroll shards and common and rare modules. Reroll shards have a 15% chance to drop. Common modules start with a 2% chance and rare modules have a 0.5% base chance. Both module rates can be increased with their respective
labs
.  The amount of reroll shards dropped by bosses increase depending on the tier you are running.

Merging Modules
Modules start as 1 of 3 rarities. The starting rarity determines how far a module can be merged and what rarity that module can be merged to.
Common: Cannot be merged.
Rare: Can be merged to Legendary+.
Epic: Can be merged to Ancestral with 5 stars (ancestral is the only rarity with stars)
What is Merging?
Increasing a Rare+ to Epic. Stats and Max level are increasing
Merging is boosting the rarity of a primary module which will also increase the main stat value and the main stat scaling. It also increases the highest level that module can reach.
Important:
Rare modules will never receive a unique ability when merging even to epic or higher.
Important:
Rare modules keep their original name. No rare will ever match with an epic that you pulled with gems.
Merge Materials
A list of merging materials can be found in game and is shown when selecting modules. The image to the left is the list of modules and the materials required in game. There are 2 icons when merging modules: 1) module icon (natural module) 2) wildcard (looks like orbs).
The module icon will always be used to denote the primary module on the left of the equation. The primary will always be the first module you click on when merging.
The icons shown after the "+" are the material quantity and type of materials needed to merge. If icon is a module icon, then it means it needs to be the same module as the primary at the rarity shown. The wildcard icon can be any module of the same type (Cannon, Armor, Generator or Core) and of the rarity shown.
Ancestral modules can be upgraded to 5 stars, each star requires an natural epic+ module and increases the main effect.
Merge Walkthrough
Using the image from the previous section, this is a sample of merging a module from rare to rare+.
Important:
The first selection screen was filtered by type: armor and rarity: Rares. After the module was selected to be merged, only valid merge materials are shown and can be selected.
Important:
Again note the primary rare name never changed and merging to epic does not give it a unique effect. It can still be used as wildcard material for a natural epic later.
Module Stats
Modules have 3 types of stats: Main Effect, Sub-Module Effects, and Unique effects.
Main Effect
The main effect will be an increase to tower damage, health, Coin Bonus or Ultimate Weapon damage based on the module type. This effect is the only effect that can be increased by leveling up the module. Leveling up modules to levels 41, 101, 141, 161, 201, and 241 unlock additional slots for sub-module effects.

Sub-Module Effects
Sub-module effects are dependent on the type of module. For instance, cannon modules will get sub-module effects that increase damage workshop stats. The rarity for the sub-module is not determined by the rarity of the module but the maximum rarity for the effect is the same as the current module rarity. This means a legendary module may have a common sub-module effect but can receive a legendary effect on a reroll. The chance of each sub-module rarity is as follows:
Rarity
Common
Rare
Epic
Legendary
Mythic
Ancestral
Chance
46.2%
40%

2.5%

for a list of effects
Sub-module effects that you do not want to be rerolled can be locked. Locking sub-module effects will raise the cost of rerolls. In addition, there is an Auto Roll feature that a player can define what effects and rarities are acceptable and have the game reroll at a fast speed until one of the acceptable selection is found. Auto roll can be canceled mid process if desired. If effect bans, such as
Cannon Effect Bans
are researched, players can define their ban selections and these will not be included in the reroll pool.

Unique Effects
Epic modules that are drawn have a
Unique Effect
. Merging rare modules to epic will not give them unique abilities. Only modules drawn as epics will have unique abilities.
Assist Modules
This is a feature unlocked as a milestone reward at Tier 19, wave 40.
For stones, you may purchase an ability to equip a second module to the same slot, providing weaker versions of its unique effect, main effect and substats. You can increase the efficiencies of these values with stones and through lab research (unlocked Tier 19, Wave 50). You won’t be able to equip modules that share the same name. The assist module will need its level upgraded for module shard to provide effects beyond first two and higher main effect; its level is distinct from the main one. Quantity Substats, like ILMq ,use a FLOOR function and not a ROUND function, meaning the quantity will not round up. For example, ancestral DW effect wave gives a quantity of 3, so to get this to actually add one quantity, a minimum level of 34% is required as 33% only gives +0.99, which is converted to +0.
Unlocking an assist slot costs 1000 stones each, and will provide you with a unique effect of Epic quality, and 1% main and sub effect bonus. These can be improved for stones, as well as via labs (unlocked at Tier 19, wave 50).
Note that this does not bypass hard caps on stats, such as limit of 98% defense, 90% slow for Chrono Field Speed reduction, 150s Wall rebuild, 7s Shockwave Frequency, 40% Death Defy, and Inner Land Mine CD of 37s.
As of patch v27.1, all assist modules' multiplier stat is changed to be multiplicative. Before, only assist generator was multiplicative, while cannon, armor, and core were additive.
