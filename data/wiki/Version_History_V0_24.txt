v0.24.0
Bot revamp
Bots have been redesigned so that their timing is more intuitive. They now work the same way as Ultimate Weapons, and they can be toggled on/off during a run. Additionally, new stats and labs have been added so that your bots can get even stronger! New Stats:
For all 4 bots, the stat ‘Frequency’ has been changed to ‘Cooldown’. Medal purchases into frequency will be refunded. Lab levels that were researched will persist.
Golden Bot - Duration
Amplify Bot - Duration
Thunder Bot - Linger%: A portion of the stun effect will remain for 3 seconds even after the thunder bot's duration
Flame Bot - Damage Reduction%: Enemies burned by Flame Bot will have a portion of their damage reduced
Labs:
Golden Bot - Increase duration
Amplify Bot - Increase duration
Thunder Bot - Increase linger time
Flame Bot - Burn Stack: Allow for successive hits to stack the burn effect
Additionally the renamed Cooldown lab (was Frequency) for all 4 Bots has been given 5 additional levels
Other:
Flame Bot now “burns” the enemy. Every second, a burned enemy takes damage equal to Flame Bot initial hit, burn stacks (allowed with the lab), makes the burn ticks faster per stack, for example a stack of 4 will make the enemy take a burn hit every 0.25s (1s/4)
Thunder Bot is now 50% effective against Bosses and Elites. Linger % is also 50% effective against Bosses and Elites.
Ultimate Weapon Improvements
We have adjusted every UW in some way. There are plenty of new upgrades to spend stones on, and several existing upgrades have been made stronger or changed to fit the game better.
Chain Lightning - Damage Scaling Changed
Chain Lightning - CL+ reworked (the new effect is capped after 100 hits on a given enemy)
Chain Lightning - Damage module substats have had their scaling changed
Smart Missiles - Damage Scaling Changed
Smart Missiles - New levels added to Cooldown and Quantity
Death Wave - Coin Bonus is applied to all enemies hit rather than only enemies killed
Death Wave - Animation was reworked to be more performant
Chrono Field - New levels added to Slow %
Chrono Field - CF+ reworked
Golden Tower - New levels added to Duration and Bonus
Golden Tower - GT+ only counts enemies that spawned during the current activation
Poison Swamp - New levels added to Duration
Black Hole - New levels added to Duration
Black Hole - BH+ reworked
Spotlight - New levels added to Angle and Quantity
Spotlight - SL+ reworked
Labs:
Chain Thunder: Every 1% of enemy health removed by chain lightning reduces enemy damage by 10% (max reduction: [lab level])
Lightning Amplifier ~ Scatter: Each Chain Lightning hit on a Scatter will amplify the damage for the next Chain Lightning hit on the same target (Additive)
Swamp Rend: When Basic Enemies are hurt by the Poison Swamp, that damage is boosted by a percent of the enemy’s current Rend Armor Mult
Swamp Rend - Additional Enemies: Increase the type of enemies that are impacted by Swamp Rend
Spawn rate & FPS improvements
Here's the big one! A large part of the game code has been rewritten to be lighter on compute. The main tangible effect is: when lag starts to happen, the game can now recover gracefully. Previously, this would just snowball and cause all new computation to lag. Spawn rate differences across game speeds have been resolved.
Tier 16, 17, 18
Three new tiers with all new Battle Conditions have been added. Additionally, the scaling of Battle Condition levels from T14 and T15 has been lessened, so that they are more gradually increased to T18. The damage and health scaling of enemies T14+ has been decreased.
Other changes

Auto Perk Priority
Perk Ban (4 more levels)
Improved Module Shatter returns
Wall Regen (20 more levels)

Mass was not being correctly boosted during runs. To not completely change game behavior since this wasn't working before, we made mass only start to be increased on high waves, but on new tiers this will work from the first wave.
Extra long boss wave cooldown removed
'recovery package after boss wave' will work on all boss waves correctly now
Wave Skip now works on all waves (including xxx9)
Wave Skipping a boss will roll for a module/reroll dice drop

We have heard your feedback around Smart Missiles damage! SM damage has been improved to be more inline with previous version values while keeping the new scaling. To maintain balance, we have buffed Poison Swamp damage, Inner Land Mine damage, and Chain Lightning damage by a similar amount.
A once per event bot respec is now available in the event store for 300 gems. All players will receive a free respec when loading from a previous game version.
Hit Text now has a menu where you can toggle many different options to get a better understanding of your tower’s strengths
Elite’s mass was reworked to be more similar to how it worked pre v24.0. It still isn’t identical, because knockback was completely redone as part of the performance changes.
The Multiverse Nexus module now rounds to the nearest whole second
BH+ and CL+ use percentage values once again
CL+ Tooltip has been updated
CL+, DW+, and BH+ now deal damage off of the
enemy's
wave health. So, with pulsar harvester, the level reduction also reduces the damage of these UWs

v0.24.3
Death Wave Rework
Death Wave has been completely reworked. It should still provide many of the benefits of today while adding many more. It works on the same Cooldown as the old Death Wave. Now, however, there is only one damage dealing wave (called the Death Wave). The Death Wave has a "damage pool" and will persist at your tower range until it has dealt that amount of damage. New activations of DW will add to the damage pool (rather than replacing it). The "damage pool" will only be reduced by the amount of damage needed to destroy an enemy (factoring in any bonuses)
The Death Wave is preceded by some number of Effect Waves.
“Quantity” has been changed to “Effect Waves”
Effect Waves have 5 utilities (all of which can be improved with labs):
Coin bonus: An enemy hit by an Effect Wave or the final Death Wave will have a coin bonus when it is destroyed
Health bonus: An enemy hit by an Effect Wave or the final Death Wave will give a 0.05% health bonus when it is destroyed
Cell bonus: An elite enemy hit by an Effect Wave or the final Death Wave will have a cell bonus applied when it is destroyed
Death Wave Damage Amplifier: Each Effect Wave hit on a given enemy will boost the damage that enemy takes from the Death Wave
Death Wave Armor Stripping: Each Effect Wave hit will strip some amount of armor from an enemy
Effect Waves range are infinite
Effect Waves have a 4 second interval
Damage Scaling has been adjusted
Damage module substat has been drastically improved
Kill Wall drastically increases the damage of the Death Wave by counting every enemy hit by an effect wave and boosting the damage by that number times the power of your Kill Wall
The Random Ultimate Weapon perk version of Death Wave will have the base health bonus and damage amplification bonus.
Other Changes
New Enemy Battle Conditions added (Fast, Ranged, Basic, Boss)
All Enemy Battle Conditions also get “boss status”: not impacted by orbs, Death Ray, Black Hole, or Black Hole damage. 50% damage from thorns
Bonus from Death Wave in the Health tooltip is now shown as a multiplier rather than a magnitude
Damage / Meter has been correctly adjusted to being based on 1 meter rather than 10 meters
Damage / Meter module substats have been increased
Rays and Vampires are now affected by CF+
Garlic Thorns was added as a new lab. Effect: Vampires are hit with a small percent of thorns damage
Bot range scales more smoothly and generously based on tower range
Thunder, Chrono Field Reduction %, and Flame bot damage reduction all work on Rays
Black Hole position is now slightly inside range at any tower range
Plasma Cannon now fires before Boss get in range
