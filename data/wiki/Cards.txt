Card Mastery Overview
Description
Cards are items that can be bought for 20
Gems
, which give a special effect based on what card you have equipped. You can only have a certain amount of cards equipped, depending on how many slots you have. A card can have a max level of 7.
Locked Cards
Cards can have a locked icon. When in a run, cards with this icon can never be removed until the round ends. It is possible to switch to other card presets containing all the same locked cards during a run, but any differences in locked cards will prevent the preset from being selected.
When a boss or fleet enemy is alive, all cards become locked and cannot be changed until all bosses/fleet enemies are killed.
Card Slots
The amount of cards you can have equipped depends on how many slots you have. The max amount of slots is 22 through
Gems
(for a total of 58,400
Gems)
, but 28 in total with the
Key
upgrades in the harmony tech tree.

Maxing A Card
To max a card you need 80 copies of 1 card, costing a total of 1600
Gems
. You will obtain copies of cards when buying cards.
Costs Per Star
1-star (unlock): 20 gems
2-star: 3 copies, 40 gems - the unlock card will count as 1/3 toward 2-stars
3-star: 5 copies, 100 gems
4-star: 8 copies, 160 gems
5-star: 12 copies, 240 gems
6-star: 20 copies, 400 gems
7-Star: 32 copies, 640 gems
With a total of 31 cards, 49600 gems are needed to reach max level for all cards.
Buying Cards
Cards can be 1 of 3 rarities: Common, Rare and Epic. When buying cards, the rarity is chosen first then a card is selected within that rarity. The chance of getting each rarity is:
Common: 80%, Rare: 17%, epic: 3%.
When card is maxed, you can no longer receive that card. Once all commons have been bought, the chance to buy a rare card is 97%. When all cards are purchased, you can no longer use the buy card button. The event mission to buy [x] cards will complete instantly after all cards are bought.
Milestones
Some cards cannot be bought until they are unlocked in
Milestones
. If all other cards are maxed before these are unlocked, you will not be able to buy more cards until a Milestone is unlocked. These cards and their unlocks are:
Recovery Package Chance - Rare - Tier 2 Wave 750
Land Mine Stun - Rare - Tier 7 Wave 250
Nuke - Epic - Tier 11 Wave 10
Ultimate Crit - Epic - Tier 14 Wave 50
Area of Effect - Epic - Tier 20 Wave 80
Note:
Despite anecdotal evidence, Death Ray DOES NOT have a lower draw rate than standard epics, and no special requirements are needed to draw it.
