Attack Chip
Tower Guardian attacks enemies with the most missing health, dealing a percentage of their lost health as damage (50% damage to bosses)
In theory this chip may be able to operate similar to a
Plasma Cannon
for non boss enemies, as the damage is percentage based and with sufficient investment it could lead to multiple target, high damage and constant / faster attacks. This all needs to be confirmed with further testing, once sufficient upgrades have been purchased.
There is a red sphere orbiting around the Guardian just before Attack activates.
