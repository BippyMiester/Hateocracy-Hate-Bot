Gems
and
Power Stones
for ranking in a certain position. Legend league will additionally reward
keys
, which can be used to unlock additional upgrades. Tournaments are the main source of power stones that are used to buy
Ultimate Weapons
Entering A Tournament
Tournaments are unlocked in
Milestones
at tier 1 wave 60. To enter a tournament you need to spend 1 Tournament
Ticket
to play 1 run. The highest wave of this run is entered into the tournament. Based on who has the highest wave you get assigned a position and rewards.
Note that tournaments can not be joined during an active run
A tournament is held every Wednesday and Saturday at 0:00AM UTC
Getting Tickets
You get a free ticket every time a tournament starts. To get extra tickets, you can either watch an ad or spend 10 gems per ticket. The gem cost increases By 10 gems for each additional ticket.
Promoting
As of v25, in each tier, top 4 players get promoted to the next league, and starting from Platinum, 6 bottom ones demoted to the league below. Bronze, Silver and Gold are "protected" tiers; once you leave Bronze and Silver, you cannot get demoted back to them.
Tournament Difficulty
Tournament leagues are based on tier +. The "+" is to indicate stronger enemy scaling than the normal tier. The differences will be an increase to how quickly enemy stats scale and the presence of Heat (Battle Conditions).
Enemy Stat Scaling
Enemy stats increase with each league where Copper League is more difficult than Tier 1 but less difficult than Tier 2 and Champion League is between Tier 11 and 12 stats. All stats will scale faster including enemy mass which effects knockback and enemy speed.

Battle Conditions
Every league aside from Bronze has a Heat mechanic, adding additional modifiers to make the tournaments more varied. This starts off weak, but ramps up in strength as you progress through the waves, reaching maximum strength at wave 1000 (with exception of "more bosses" - see below)
Each league has a "More bosses" heat; starting from a boss every 10 waves in Bronze, you have one every 9 waves in Silver, every 8 in Gold, etc. - up to every 5 waves in Legends. Unlike other heat mechanics, this stays static over waves. For a full list of Tournament Battle conditions, see below.
