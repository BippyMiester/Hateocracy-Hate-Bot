The Wave Skip
card
is a complex card with many interactions both positive and negative. There are 2 main categories: wave based and income based.
Wave Based Interactions
Waves Skipped: Can trigger on multiple waves in a row causing multiple waves to be skipped.
Free Upgrades
: Tests for each wave completed after the skips, meaning that skipped waves can trigger more free upgrades.
Enemy Level Skips
: Can activate up to as many waves were skipped for both Enemy Health/Attack Level Skip.
Energy Shield
: Time is not skipped so Energy Shield will need more waves between charges.
Demon Mode
: Time is not skipped so Demon Mode will last more waves.
Income Based Interactions
All income earned on the last wave will be x1.1 even if the bonus was earned from
Ultimate Weapons
or
Golden Bot
Cells are earned based on how many cells were earned on the previous wave.
When multiple waves are skipped in a row, the amount is calculated x1.1^(# of wave skipped).
