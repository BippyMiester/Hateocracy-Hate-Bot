Ultimate Weapon Plus
Basic Upgrades
Basic upgrades for all Ultimate Weapons are located in the
Ultimate Weapon
menu after unlocking the Ultimate Weapon. Unlocking grants the abilities to upgrade Duration, Slow and Cooldown using stones.
Chrono Field is unique in that it is the only Ultimate Weapon with a cooldown that can be active constantly. In fact, duration can last 10 seconds longer than cooldown at its lowest. Chrono Field effect cannot stack on itself. Any remaining time from the previous activation is wasted.
Cost
Duration has 35 levels, Slow has 11 levels and Cooldown has 12 levels. The total stone cost is 9,946.

Chrono Loop Mechanics
The following is accredited to Priesten, yournicknm, and Tremnen:
CF+ exerts a tangental force on enemies within CF Range, causing them to spiral around the tower as they approach. The rotation rate stated in-game for each CF+ level is the theta value (θ), or the distance measured in radians traveled per 2 seconds. With low enough enemy speeds, enemies will appear to be perpetually in orbit around the tower, having faster orbital cycles with higher CF+ levels
