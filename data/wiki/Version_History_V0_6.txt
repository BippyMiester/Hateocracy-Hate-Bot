Balance
Waves starting at roughly wave 60 and above will have higher scaling for difficulty to end rounds a bit earlier (more health, slightly faster spawn rate, slightly higher chance of tanks and fast enemies). The general reason for this is to shorten rounds across the board as it was never designed to run for an hour plus. It will also help balance defensive builds as below, expect more changes though
Scaling of attack damage of enemies reduced to help make defensive builds better
Tier's difficulty spread out a wee bit more making higher tiers more difficult
Health upgrade scaling buffed considerably
Defense Absolute and Health Regen buffed
Lifesteal max level decreased from 99 to 80
Smart missiles starting missile quantity raised from 3 to 4
Smart missiles max quantity raised from 14 to 15
