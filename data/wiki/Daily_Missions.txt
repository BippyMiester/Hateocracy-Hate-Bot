Reroll Daily Mission
Description
Daily missions are progress based challenges given every 8 hours. Completion of daily challenges provide coins and gems. Completing enough daily missions will earn access to weekly rewards.
Challenges
Unlike
events
, daily missions are given based on player progress. This means you will only be given
card
and
ultimate weapon
challenges when you have the corresponding unlock. Players will have different challenges than each other and are able to complete all challenges received.
Rewards
Daily missions will give 3 gems and a number of coins and shards based on the highest tier unlocked. The highest tier unlocked will also impact coins from weekly rewards and guild rewards. The amount of shards per mission can be increased with the
Daily Mission Shards
lab.
