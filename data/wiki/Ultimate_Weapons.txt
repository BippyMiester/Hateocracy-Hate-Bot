Description
Ultimate Weapons are tools that can be bought for
Power Stones
. They provide different advantages that can be very useful. Each Ultimate Weapon has 3 upgradable stats once unlocked. Despite being named weapons, not every Ultimate Weapon has the ability do deal damage, although they could gain it when upgraded. As you progress, you will also gain access to Ultimate Weapon Plus abilities.

Buying
Ultimate Weapons can be purchased when you have enough Power Stones. The price is determined by the number of Ultimate Weapons you currently own. Each time an Ultimate Weapon is bought, there will be 3 options chosen at random. All options have an equal chance of showing up.
It is possible to close the menu without buying by clicking outside the Ultimate Weapon menu or closing the app. The choices given do not change until one is purchased.

Using Ultimate Weapons
All Ultimate Weapons owned can be used in a round at the same time including Ultimate Weapons given by perks. They will automatically activate when the cooldown timer hits zero. The timer resets immediately even if the Ultimate Weapon is active.
Ultimate Weapons can be toggled on and off during a round. Toggling off will reset the cooldown timer when turned on. Ultimate Weapons can only be toggled on/off 40 times in a run.
Damage Calculations
Damage dealing Ultimate Weapons will factor critical damage and super critical damage into their total damage displayed in the Ultimate Weapon workshop screen during a round. The damage formula is as follows:
Ultimate Weapon Damage = UW Multiplier * Core Module Multiplier *
Damage
* (1 +
Critical Factor
Critical Chance
) * (1 +
Super Crit Mult
Super Crit Chance
* Critical Chance)
Card
When you equip the
card
"Ultimate Crit," damage dealing Ultimate Weapons will have a chance to deal a critical hit using the crit factor stat from your workshop when an enemy is hit (does not apply to % based damage). The formula is as follows:
Critical Ultimate Weapon Damage = Ultimate Weapon Damage * Critical Factor
