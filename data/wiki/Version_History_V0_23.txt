v0.23 - Invaders Update
Elite enemies from another galaxy are invading the Tower territory! These mysterious enemies of triangle shape show up in all tiers. Their chances of appearing will increase more and more as you progress to higher waves.
New Enemies
There are 3 types of Elite enemies:
Vampire:
Vampires drain Tower health constantly while they are in range. Wall and Energy Shield do not prevent this effect. While a Vampire drains the Tower, both Health Regen and Lifesteal are disabled. Vampires have high knockback resistance and drain doesn't activate thorns.
Scatter:
Scatter will split into smaller versions of itself when defeated. The smaller versions will then split again. Scatters have high knockback resistance.
Ray
Once Ray reaches Tower range, it will charge for a time before firing a powerful ray at the Tower. Rays are completely immune to knockback.
All Elite enemies are immune to orbs, Death Ray, Shockwave, and Black Hole. When defeated, Elite enemies will drop
Elite Cells
. You will be able to use these cells to SPEED UP LABS!
Elite Cells and Lab Boosts
Lab Speed Up Elite Cells are used to activate a boost for lab slots to make them work faster, increasing their rate by up to 5x speed for up to 24 hours. The Elite Cell cost per boost increases with higher speed, duration, and number of labs being boosted.
Workshop Enhancements
To help repel these invaders, a lab research has been added to unlock workshop enhancements. This new panel offers various upgrades with percentage increases! The more coins you invest in enhancements, the more upgrade options will become available.
New Features
Two new slots added to active cards.
New epic card Nuke, when activated will kill onscreen enemies. Can be used at any time (similar to Demon Mode).
New labs to recharge limited-use abilities after a number of waves: Second Wind, Demon Mode, Missile Barrage and the new Nuke.
Wall Fortification lab added that allows Health Regen to increase Wall Health beyond its maximum value.
Added ability to reroll daily missions (lab research to unlock).
Modules Additions and Changes
After you stop rerolling module sub effects, a new panel will show up asking if you want to keep the new effects or rollback to the effects that you had at the start (reroll shards used will be spent either way).
Modules can be marked as favorites now. These modules will show up first in inventory, can't be selected as fodder on merge, can't be shattered, and are completely ignored by auto merge (do manual merge or unfavorite it to use auto merge).
Modules can be unmerged (lab research to unlock). The fodder modules will be converted to shards.
Equipped modules will be visible on the player's profile.
Fixed Astral Deliverance not applying bounce extra damage.
Other Changes and Fixes
Optimization on enemy physics that allows us to completely remove Black Hole freeze.
