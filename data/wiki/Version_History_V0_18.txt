Milestones
• New feature, milestones. Earn rewards for completing higher and higher waves on each tier. This will be how new game features are unlocked going forward. You can earn new lab research, cards, and premium currency. It currently gives rewards up to wave 2000, but 2500 will be coming in an upcoming update that includes exclusive tower skins as well
Performance
• Massive performance improvement for how enemies interact with each other. Defensive builds should be much less laggy. (this was completed in 0.17.12)
• Orbs are no longer reliant on game FPS
Standard Rounds
• New Enemy: Protector - Enemies inside protector's range cannot be insta killed by orbs or death ray. The goal of this enemy is to reduce reliance on insta kills, make rounds end sooner, and make higher range towers more viable. The smaller the tower range, the more impactful the protector is since it's radius remains unchanged. This enemy may set wave records back a bit, but other upgrades were added to further push your tower's limits
• Enemy speed growth for normal rounds reduced a bit
• Enemy mass now grows very slowly starting on wave 50. Example: Wave 500 = 500 x1.14 mass, Wave 3000 = x1.89
• Max enemies on screen raised from 100 to 120
• Enemy spawn rate above wave 3000 for every tier increased slightly
• Resume round feature restrictions loosened. Max resumes from 3 to 10. Minimum wave progression from 15 to 10 waves
• Tier 13 added
Tournaments
• Cooldown wave timer reduced by 50% to speed up runs, and add a bit of difficulty
• Enemy speed growth reduced
• Enemy health and attack scaling increased slightly
• Enemy mass now slowly grows after wave 50, reducing knockback
• Protector enemy slightly more prevalent in tournaments than standard rounds
• Enemy spawn rate above wave 50 increased, and slightly grows faster
Workshop
• Land mine damage max level raised from 90 to 200
• Land mine radius max level raised from 35 to 50
