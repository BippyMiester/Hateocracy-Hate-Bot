v27 Update
Hello Tower Defenders, it's update time! Let's dive into the new content:
Rollout begins today with the goal to have it to 100% of players by 11 AM CST tomorrow
New Enemy: Fleets
A new enemy type has invaded higher tiers! Fleets is a new enemy type that spawns in Tiers 14 and up. This new enemy type has a large amount of health, bringing a new challenge to battles. Fleets approach your Tower with a group of enemies, and are not impacted by direct targeting. Fleets spawn less often at lower tiers, and more frequently at higher ones.
We’re introducing three enemy types under Fleets:
Commander: A passive unit that stays outside of the Tower's range, empowering enemy health within its area of effect.
Overcharge: An attacker that stops outside of the Tower's range, shooting a returning projectile that doubles its power with each subsequent hit.
Saboteur: A specialized unit that latches onto the Tower, disabling a random UW on impact and restoring the UW when it is defeated.
New Tiers
We have added Tiers 19, 20, and 21 into the game. These new tiers are paired with new milestones and a stronger presence of Fleets. Here’s a look at the new content available:
New Card
The newest card, Area of Effect, increases AOE damage to specific sources: Inner Land Mine, Poison Swamp, Smart Missile, Flame Bot, and Land Mine. Area of Effect Mastery increases the range of all damage area of effects, and unlocks additional research.
This card is unlocked as a mastery reward at Tier 20. Additionally, the prerequisites for unlocking Card Mastery stays at 30 maxed cards, so your access to Card Mastery is not impacted by new milestone content.
Assist Modules
The Assist Modules feature unlocks as a milestone reward in Tier 19, Wave 40. Players can spend stones to unlock an Assist Module slot for each module type. When an Assist Module slot is unlocked, you can equip a module that matches that slot type.
Assist Modules maintain their Main Effect, Unique Effect, and Substats at a reduced efficiency. You can increase the efficiencies of these values with stones and through lab research (unlocked Tier 19, Wave 50). You won’t be able to equip modules that share the same name.
New Labs
We have a number of new labs available as milestone unlocks, including:
Enhancement Coin Discount labs for Attack, Defense, and Utility,
Attack and Health labs for Ray, Vampire, and Scatter,
Ranged Enemy Range lab (added at Tier 13, Wave 80),
Assist Module labs for Substat and Bonus efficiencies across all four types,
Four groups of Battle Condition Reduction labs, reducing the effect of specific Battle Conditions by a percentage.,
Modules
Assist Modules have introduced another layer of power to your Tower’s build. As such, most Modules have remained unchanged. One Module, however, was due for a revision:
Om Chip
Om Chip has a new Unique Effect: “Spotlight will rotate to focus a Boss. Bosses reflect the light around it to nearby enemies, increasing by x2/x4/x7/x15 the damage they receive”
New Modules
We have several new Modules being added to the game. The first module will be available in the Feature Banner on August 25, 2025 7:00 PM
Featured Module Banners will have a two week duration, followed by a one week break. When the next Featured Module Banner goes live, the previous module will enter into the Standard Banner.
Guardians
We have two changes to existing Guardian chips:
Ally
The Ally chip has a reworked ability: Converts an enemy into an Ally Recovery Package that can heal the Tower beyond the basic Maximum Recovery amount. It’s three values have changed to Recovery Amount, Max Recovery, and Cooldown.
Bounty (previously Steal)
Steal has been renamed to Bounty and given an adjustment to its ability: Tower Guardian places a bounty on nearby non-common enemies, causing them to grant more coins on death.
Attack Speed Refactor
We have refactored how attack speed functions to improve its calculation across all game speeds, and to allow for infinitely high attack speeds. This change includes an improvement in attack speed performance at higher game speeds.
Changelog

Added ability for Black Hole Coin Bonus to apply to all enemies that die inside of Black Hole, even if Black Hole has no effect on them.

Vampire Ultimate: Vampire drains x% faster,
New Battle Condition in Tier 21: Mass Enforcement: Surviving enemies' mass increases by {x}% per wave they are alive,

On The Horizon
With the release of V27, we’ll be taking time to assess and expand existing systems. We look forward to expanding Guilds content for Season 5, taking another pass at refining events, and optimizing our game settings (battle history, anyone?) A bit further into the horizon, we’ll be taking a look at the main gameplay loop. One of our goals is to make gameplay cash more impactful for late-game players.
Note of the Future of Guardians
Guardians and Guardians Chips were designed as an accessible feature that all players can access through Guilds, and can be upgraded through consistent effort. As the Guilds feature expands, we want to explore the future of Guardians, including how to make Chips evolve with the player as they progress through the game.

The team has expanded support and hired a QA lead.
v27.2 (November 17, 2025)
Hello Tower Defenders! We are rolling out a minor patch now on Android, and this update should be fully available to everyone tomorrow, before the tournament starts.
Here is a look at the upcoming changes:
In-Game Support Ticketing
We have added a new Support button in the in-game Settings menu. When issuing a ticket, your player ID and linked email will automatically be populated. From there, you can select your issue type, add in a subject line, and include a description of your issue.
Battle History
This update expanded the functionality of the Battle History feature, allowing you to delete entries. The first time you navigate to the Battle History page after updating, you’ll see a new information panel. To delete entries, press and hold on any entry, check the box next to entries you wish to remove, and press Delete to confirm.
Note
: This will not pull past Battle History logs to populate back up to the maximum of 20 entries.
Leaderboard Reset
We fixed a bug where the newest tiers were not populating correctly in the in-game leaderboard. This change will be visible with a leaderboard reset. We plan to reset the leaderboard before the tournament when the build has fully rolled out.
Changelog
Added a 20 gem incentive for linking your player account.
If you’ve already linked your account, you’ll be rewarded the gems automatically!
Added a new behavior to delete entries in the Battle History. (See above for details.)
Added weekly free gem gift on the web store, in addition to the daily in game free gems.
Updated the in-game info for Guilds to include information about Token expiry and the gem conversion.

Fixed an issue where the Wall still occasionally allowed enemies to tunnel through.
Fixed an issue where the Nuke card shows an incorrect number of waves before recharging in the lab selection view.
Fixed an issue where Target Priority did not correctly target Protectors.
Fixed a visual bug in the Shatter screen displaying overlapping text when the shard quantity surpassed 1,000.

Fixed an issue where module substat text was not auto-adjusting its size in some languages.
Improved Leaderboard information to include Tiers 19, 20, and 21.
Fixed a bugged interaction where Scatter children did not interact correctly with the Commander’s buff radius.
v27.2.2 (December 1, 2025)
Hello Tower Defenders! We have a new build going out on Android shortly, with a full roll-out shortly after. Here is a look at the upcoming changes:
Lab Refactor
We have reworked our entire lab system! This change should address many outstanding lab issues, notably regarding offline lab speedup progress. This adjustment is fully internal and does not have any functionality or UI changes.
Orbital Augment Adjustments
The Orbital Augment module has been adjusted to specifically try and remove infinite runs:
Adds [2/4/6/8] orbiting Electrons around the tower. Each Electron deals damage equal to 15% of the enemy's remaining health (quarter effective against Bosses and Fleets)
What does this mean?
This change will stop players from using Orbital Augment as the sole means to kill enemies. However, it will also make the module way stronger against more enemy types. Let's walk through some examples of what this might look like for different enemy types:
Basics
(1x wave health): The first hit will deal 15% damage, the second 12.8%, and so on. Previously, it was 10% per hit. This new formula is stronger until 7 Electron hits
Tanks
(4x wave health): The new module works the exact same way for Tanks as it does for Basics. Previously, it was 2.5% per hit. This new formula is stronger until 40 Electron hits
Bosses
(20x wave health): The first hit will deal 3.75% damage, the second 3.6%, and so on. Previously, it was 0.5% per hit. This new formula is stronger until 200 Electron hits
In addition to the changes, we have also worked on a fix to the Electrons desyncing as a result of a longer game session. We have also added Electron Damage in the stats panel.
Fleets at Higher Waves
We are now adding fleets to all tiers. Tier 1 will have Fleets starting at wave 15,000, and each subsequent tier will have Fleets appear 250 waves earlier (T2 = 14,750, T3 = 14,500, etc). Once they appear, they will spawn every 100 waves.
We are continuing to develop systems that make the higher waves at each tier more challenging. There was a section in today's Monday Morning Announcement about TTG's stance on Infinite Runs. Additionally, in the next few updates, we will aim to improve tournament run length. We want to ensure it remains competitive and fun, while reducing its duration overall.
Changelog,
Implemented a lab refactor to resolve issues including offline research syncing,
Adjusted Orbital Augment’s description and gameplay:,
Adds [2/4/6/8] orbiting Electrons around the tower. Each Electron deals damage equal to 15% of the enemy's remaining health (quarter effective against Bosses and Fleets),
Fixed an issue where Electrons would desync over the course of a longer run,
Added Electron Damage to stats panel,
Added Fleets to all Tiers at higher waves,
Adjusted the Stone Pack offer to feature icons instead of text,
Fixed a UI issue where the “Game Paused” message overlaps in some menus,
Fixed a UI issue where the the Milestone Pass description did not indent into a new line, making the description too small,
Fixed an issue were enemy mass did not fit in the Info Panel screen,
Fixed an issue where the new Support panel unpauses a paused run,
Adjusted the date displays in Battle History and tournaments so it correctly localizes to the player’s region.
V27.3 Patch Notes - December 18, 2025,
Hello Tower Defenders! We are rolling out our last minor update of the year now on Android, with iOS rolling out within the next day. This build should be fully available to everyone tomorrow. Here’s a look at the changes:
New Toggles Menu,
We have added a new "Toggles" menu to replace our current "Hit Texts" button in the Settings. Some existing buttons, such as 120FPS and Cinematic of Idle have moved into this menu, while Sound and Music will remain in the Settings menu. Here is a look at our current list of toggles:
Added Auto Pause in Menus,
Added Stone Confirmation,
Turning off this toggle will remove the confirmation for stone purchases that costs 100 stones or more,
Added Gem Confirmations,
Same as Stones, but for Gem purchases equal to or greater than 200,
Added Ranged Enemy Shooting Line,
Added Show Cinematic Gems,
Added Brighter Spotlight,
Auto Restart has been removed from the end of round screen and added to this section for players who have unlocked this Vault upgrade,
Lab Improvements,
We have made some improvements to our Labs UI. To start, we made the lab sliders into actual sliders! Setting values has become easier, with an - and + symbol on either side to make incremental changes. Additionally, we've added a new Slider filter to the Research selection screen so you can see all labs that have sliders.
Additionally, we have fixed an issue where some longer researches were not ticking properly. This was a floating point number issue that was only apparently in some instances.
Tournament Adjustments,
We are adding two new permanent battle conditions to tournaments and adjusting our old Enemy Level Skip Reduction BC from all tournaments. Additionally, we are making tier scaling adjustments in Champions and Legends.
Let’s dive into the changes:
Skip Decay
Description: Enemy health and attack level skip chances are reduced by [VAL]% every [N] waves.
VAL starts at 1% and is the value that the generic Battle Condition Reduction lab will impact.
N is the number of waves it takes between activations of the BC, and this is what the level of the BC will impact.
Finally, the level of the BC will change based on the tournament league and not increase in strength during the run, similar to how More Bosses works.
Legends: Level 80 => Every 20 waves, lose 1% from ELS,
Champion: Level 60 => Every 40 waves, lose 1% from ELS,
Platinum: Level 40 => Every 60 waves, lose 1% from ELS,
Gold: Level 20 => Every 80 waves, lose 1% from ELS,
Skip Reduction - Multiply
Description: Enemy health and attack level skip chances are multiplied by x.[VAL],
This new Battle Condition will be impacted by the existing Enemy Level Skip Reduction Lab (which has been renamed to Skip Reduction Lab).
VAL is impacted by both BC labs (generic and specific) and is tied to the level of the Battle Condition:
Legends: Level 55 => multiplied by x0.45,
Champion: Level 40 => multiplied by x0.6,
Platinum: Level 25 => multiplied by x0.75,
Gold: Level 10 => multiplied by x0.9,
Removing Enemy Level Skip Reduction,
The previous ELS Reduction BC has been rebranded to Skip Reduction - Subtract. It has been removed from all tournaments. It will remain untouched on the normal tiers it was already a Battle Condition for. The Skip Reduction lab will still impact this Battle Condition
Tier Scaling,
Finally, we are changing the tier scaling in the Champions and Legends league. The tier scaling will change from [1/3/5/8/11/14] to [1/3/5/8/12/17]
Changelog,
Gameplay
Added one more Card slots that cost gems (10,000),
To avoid future Wall tunneling issues, the tower is now immune to all damage except from Vampires while the Wall is active,
Enemy Level Skip Reduction has been renamed to Skip Reduction. In addition, it's impact on stats will now be visible in the utility workshop tab during a run.,

When Fleets are introduced at later waves, only one Fleet will drop rewards in that wave even if multiple Fleets are present,
All 3 enhancement discount labs have had their formula changed from cost / (1 + %) to cost * (1 - %),
Primordial Collapse no longer provides double benefit on the Wall and projectiles,
UI,
Added the functionality for players to hide pop-up confirmations for the rest of the session,
Added a Pulsar Harvester stat to the Boss Breakdown that displays the amount of Level reduction applied instead of only the damage dealt,

Added functionality for all menus to be viewable (but unchangeable) while mid run,
The boss stats menu will now always show the health (and subsequent stats) of the most recently spawned boss.,

Other Changes,

Add behavior for unclaimed Guild rewards to be mailed to your inventory,
