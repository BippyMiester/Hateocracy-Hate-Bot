Perk Labs
Description
Perks are advantages earned in a round.
Unlocking Perks
Perks are initially unlocked in
labs
. To access the lab you will need to unlock and complete the Unlock Perks lab in
Milestones
at tier 2 wave 150.
Waves Required
Perks are earned starting at wave 200. After selecting 20 perks, waves required is increased to 250, 300 waves required after 30 perks, and 350 waves required after 40 perks selected.
The base can be reduced by upgrading "
Waves Required
" lab and by selecting the "Perk Wave Requirement" perk. Use the below formula to find the waves required.
Waves Required* = (Base Waves Required - Waves Required lab) * (1 - (Perk Wave Required Perk * (1 + Standard Perk Bonus / 100)))
*The formula should only be used to find the 1st perk for each base waves. If you get a decimal, you need to round the answer down. The rounded answer can be multiplied by number of perks.
EX: SPB of 8% and 3 PWR for PWR Perk for PWR 64.8%. (200-3) * (1 - 0.648) = 69.344 = 69 waves required.
Perk Choice
Initially you can select from 2 perks generated at random. Perk choices can be increased to a max of 4 choices through the "
Perk Option Quantity
" lab. It
is
possible for all perks to be trade-off perks, even if other perks are available.
The "
First Perk Choice
" lab will allow your selection to be guaranteed to appear on the first set of choices as the top choice.
When using the
Auto Pick Perk
, it will always select the top choice on the list, this will always pick your first perk choice.
Standard Perk Math
Most standard perks can be selected more than once in a round. The game has 2 formulas for multiplicative and additive perks.
For additive perks (Def %, Perks Wave Required):
Total Bonus = Base Value x Quantity x (1 + Standard Perk Bonus)
For multiplicative perks (Coin Bonus, Health, Damage):
Total Bonus = (1 + Base Value x Quantity) x (1 + Standard Perk Bonus)
List of Perks
These are all the available perks. Standard perks have a 65% chance of appearing, UW perks have a 20% chance of appearing, and Trade Off perks have a 15% chance of appearing.

Ultimate weapon perks will only be shown when the affected
Ultimate Weapon
is unlocked
If the ultimate weapon is unlocked from the "Unlock a random ultimate weapon" perk, the Ultimate Weapon perk will become available for that run.
Golden Tower Bonus perk does not apply to the GT bonus submodule Effect
Random ultimate weapon stats
When the random ultimate weapon perk is obtained during a run, it will select one that you currently don't own and give you a semi upgraded version. Unlocking a weapon this way
doesn't
allow you to do lab research on the weapon E.g. getting poison swamp will not allow you to research swamp stun or swamp radius labs. Sub stats on modules
will
affect the chosen weapon if applicable E.g. +damage multi ILM will increase the multiplier by the given amount. When all UW are unlocked, this perk is removed from the perk pool.
