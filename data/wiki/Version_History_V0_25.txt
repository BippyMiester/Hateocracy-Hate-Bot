v0.25.0 - Legends Update
Card Mastery
After years of research, our top scientists have finally made a breakthrough in the card system. Each card has a unique “Mastery” that can be unlocked using stones. This Mastery will add an immediate benefit to your card, and it will unlock a new lab that will let you level up the effect even more. These new upgrades are very expensive but will allow for a wider variety of strategies. Card Mastery can be accessed once the milestone for T16W100 is claimed and a player owns all copies of every card.
Interface Improvements
Lab Screen
Search has been added to the labs
History tab has been added to the labs (it will not contain labs researched before v25)
Lab sections can be collapsed
Individual labs can be favorited
Favorited labs show up even if they are complete
The number of levels in the lab can be seen on the Lab Info panel
A new toggle exists to auto research labs. If you have enough coins to research the next level, it will automatically start once the previous level finishes.
Labs with partial progress will have their time remaining highlighted in green
Labs with an adjustable level have a slightly more intuitive UX
Labs with at least 1 level researched will stay visible - even if the underlying mechanic is lost (through respec)
Resume Round
A round can now be resumed 25 times
The Resume Round option will now tell you the number of resumes remaining
The 10 wave limit for resumes has been removed
Tournaments can only be resumed while online
You can now close out of the Resume Round pop up without losing your run (various screens will be locked)
Closing the app twice in a row without resuming will no longer end your run
Miscellaneous
Added a new “Cinematic Mode” that removes all the elements from the UI except the tower. It can be toggled on in the Settings Menu. Cinematic mode can also be manually activated by pinching the screen during a round. What a beautiful screensaver!
The full info panels for Ultimate Weapons and Bots now show the value of the next level.
In many out-of-round views, a dropdown arrow has been added to the header that will show a list of all current currencies
Tournament Changes
We have heard all the feedback about tournaments and made several small changes that will hopefully fix many of the existing problems - without changing how players think about tournaments.
We have added a Legends league (T14+)
We have changed the rewards for almost every rank such that doing better will always net more (or the same amount) of stones. To do this some individual ranks were lowered, but it is an explicit increase in stones - especially with Legends expanding the ceiling.
Copper and Silver are now “protected” tiers. Once a player is promoted out of them, they can never be demoted back into them.
The Boss Bottle Condition is permanent (without heat up) in all leagues. 1 boss for every 10 waves in Copper, 1 boss for every 9 waves in Silver, … , 1 boss for every 5 waves in Legends
The Death Defy OR Energy Shield Battle Condition is permanent for all leagues Platinum and up
Battle Conditions have been adjusted such that there is 1 in Silver, 2 in Gold, 3 in Platinum, 4 in Champion, and 5 in Legends. This does not count the previous two special exceptions for tournament Battle Conditions.
The limit on boss drops of Modules and Reroll dice have been removed
Ties will give both players the better reward
Only the top 4 players in a bracket will be promoted. Only the bottom 6 will be demoted.
Tournament relics have been changed to reflect the new tournament league. Existing relics will be grandfathered in.
Tournament tickets will now start to increase in price after the first one is purchased with gems
Unclaimed tournament rewards will be mailed to players after the window to claim ends (this includes corresponding promotion and demotion)
Tournaments will extend for an additional 4 hours past the time to join a bracket. This time will allow for players to finish any active runs, but they will not be able to join a new bracket or start a new run.
Legends introduces a new currency: Keys. Keys can be used in a one of two new upgrade tree - Power (tower related buffs) and Harmony (non tower related buffs and QoL)
The Vault (where the above trees are located) is hidden until a player obtains at least one key.
Other changes
Daily Reward boxes have a level 30 and level 35 added
New missions have been added to the pool
The first day of the event will now always have 7 missions (5 set + 2 random)
Module Effect reroll costs have been decreased slightly
Module Effects now require being online to reroll

Rend Enhancement now affects not only the maximum multiplier, but also chance and multiplier increase per hit.
Wave Skip applies the DW cell bonus if the DW ring is active while skipping
Enemy Attack/Health Level Skip is now deterministic
Crit Chance over 100% is now allowed and will impact UW damage
Super Tower and Ultimate Tower will both show in the affected stats when they are active
If a user has already unlocked every upgrade in a certain workshop tab (attack, defense, utility), the info popups about each upgrade no longer appear when they are unlocked after a respec.
Two new card slots are available
Intro sprint now gives you a wave at regular speed but skips 10 levels at a time. Bosses can’t drop modules or reroll dice while it is running. Wave Skip will not activate. Demon Mode, Nuke, and Missile Barrage can not be used.
Cards have an option to be bought ten at a time

Ties will now equally share all the awards the players are tied for. So if two people are tied for 1st, they will take the average of the 1st and 2nd place rewards. If 30 people are tied, they will take the average of all rewards from a bracket.
Feature Adjustments
6x lab boost has been added as a lab speed up option
The cost of lab speed ups is no longer increased by 20% for every other lab being boosted. To account for this, the cost of boosting a lab 3x and higher has been raised to the average cost of running all 5 labs (net neutral).
