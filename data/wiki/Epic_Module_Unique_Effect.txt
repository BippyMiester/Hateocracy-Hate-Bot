Notes
Space displacer uses the lv1 x30 damage multiplier if the ultimate weapon is not unlocked. If you do have the ILM unlocked, the stats and effects of your ILM will be used. This means sub effects such as +ILM damage multiplier will affect total damage.
Enemies still count as "hit" by shockwave/orbs for NMP/ACP effects even if they are immune to the effects.

Note for Dimension Core:  ‎
Base shock mult with lab maxed is 1.66x (1 + 0.66)  ‎
Base shock mult after doubled by dim core effect 2.32x (1 + 1.32)  ‎
Shock mult stacking is additive and of the form: 1 + 1.32*n so for 20 stacks this would be 1 + 1.32*20 = 27.4x total mult once fully stacked
