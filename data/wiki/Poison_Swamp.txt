Description
Spawn a Poison Swamp that deals damage every second and stays active for a duration. (Accounts for crit/super crit factor and chance)
Enemies who are damaged by Poison swamp have the "Poisoned" tag until death. Poisoned enemies move 25% slower(while in a poison swamp) and are subject to the effects of
Harmony Conductor Mod
if equipped.
Note: Although undocumented in release notes, PS seems to have the effect of the previous PS+0, increasing with 50% base damage every second. This can be seen using in-game Hit-text. What seems to be the interaction with PS damage ramping is the second tick of damage is documented boost, such as 50% for base, and the subsequent ticks increase by the documented value +100%. For a PS damage of 100x with base ramping, the ticks would be 100x, 150x, 300x, 450x, 600x...
