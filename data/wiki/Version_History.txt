Patch Notes
v27 Update
Hello Tower Defenders, it's update time! Let's dive into the new content:
Rollout begins today with the goal to have it to 100% of players by 11 AM CST tomorrow
New Enemy: Fleets
A new enemy type has invaded higher tiers! Fleets is a new enemy type that spawns in Tiers 14 and up. This new enemy type has a large amount of health, bringing a new challenge to battles. Fleets approach your Tower with a group of enemies, and are not impacted by direct targeting. Fleets spawn less often at lower tiers, and more frequently at higher ones.
We’re introducing three enemy types under Fleets:
Commander: A passive unit that stays outside of the Tower's range, empowering enemy health within its area of effect.
Overcharge: An attacker that stops outside of the Tower's range, shooting a returning projectile that doubles its power with each subsequent hit.
Saboteur: A specialized unit that latches onto the Tower, disabling a random UW on impact and restoring the UW when it is defeated.
New Tiers
We have added Tiers 19, 20, and 21 into the game. These new tiers are paired with new milestones and a stronger presence of Fleets. Here’s a look at the new content available:
New Card
The newest card, Area of Effect, increases AOE damage to specific sources: Inner Land Mine, Poison Swamp, Smart Missile, Flame Bot, and Land Mine. Area of Effect Mastery increases the range of all damage area of effects, and unlocks additional research.
This card is unlocked as a mastery reward at Tier 20. Additionally, the prerequisites for unlocking Card Mastery stays at 30 maxed cards, so your access to Card Mastery is not impacted by new milestone content.
Assist Modules
The Assist Modules feature unlocks as a milestone reward in Tier 19, Wave 40. Players can spend stones to unlock an Assist Module slot for each module type. When an Assist Module slot is unlocked, you can equip a module that matches that slot type.
Assist Modules maintain their Main Effect, Unique Effect, and Substats at a reduced efficiency. You can increase the efficiencies of these values with stones and through lab research (unlocked Tier 19, Wave 50). You won’t be able to equip modules that share the same name.
New Labs
We have a number of new labs available as milestone unlocks, including:
Enhancement Coin Discount labs for Attack, Defense, and Utility,
Attack and Health labs for Ray, Vampire, and Scatter,
Ranged Enemy Range lab (added at Tier 13, Wave 80),
Assist Module labs for Substat and Bonus efficiencies across all four types,
Four groups of Battle Condition Reduction labs, reducing the effect of specific Battle Conditions by a percentage.,
Modules
Assist Modules have introduced another layer of power to your Tower’s build. As such, most Modules have remained unchanged. One Module, however, was due for a revision:
Om Chip
Om Chip has a new Unique Effect: “Spotlight will rotate to focus a Boss. Bosses reflect the light around it to nearby enemies, increasing by x2/x4/x7/x15 the damage they receive”
New Modules
We have several new Modules being added to the game. The first module will be available in the Feature Banner on August 25, 2025 7:00 PM
Featured Module Banners will have a two week duration, followed by a one week break. When the next Featured Module Banner goes live, the previous module will enter into the Standard Banner.
Guardians
We have two changes to existing Guardian chips:
Ally
The Ally chip has a reworked ability: Converts an enemy into an Ally Recovery Package that can heal the Tower beyond the basic Maximum Recovery amount. It’s three values have changed to Recovery Amount, Max Recovery, and Cooldown.
Bounty (previously Steal)
Steal has been renamed to Bounty and given an adjustment to its ability: Tower Guardian places a bounty on nearby non-common enemies, causing them to grant more coins on death.
Attack Speed Refactor
We have refactored how attack speed functions to improve its calculation across all game speeds, and to allow for infinitely high attack speeds. This change includes an improvement in attack speed performance at higher game speeds.

A bit further into the horizon, we’ll be taking a look at the main gameplay loop. One of our goals is to make gameplay cash more impactful for late-game players.
Note of the Future of Guardians
Guardians and Guardians Chips were designed as an accessible feature that all players can access through Guilds, and can be upgraded through consistent effort.

The team has expanded support and hired a QA lead.
v27.2 (November 17, 2025)
Hello Tower Defenders! We are rolling out a minor patch now on Android, and this update should be fully available to everyone tomorrow, before the tournament starts.
Here is a look at the upcoming changes:
In-Game Support Ticketing
We have added a new Support button in the in-game Settings menu. When issuing a ticket, your player ID and linked email will automatically be populated. From there, you can select your issue type, add in a subject line, and include a description of your issue.
Battle History
This update expanded the functionality of the Battle History feature, allowing you to delete entries. The first time you navigate to the Battle History page after updating, you’ll see a new information panel. To delete entries, press and hold on any entry, check the box next to entries you wish to remove, and press Delete to confirm.
Note
: This will not pull past Battle History logs to populate back up to the maximum of 20 entries.
Leaderboard Reset
We fixed a bug where the newest tiers were not populating correctly in the in-game leaderboard. This change will be visible with a leaderboard reset. We plan to reset the leaderboard before the tournament when the build has fully rolled out.
Changelog
Added a 20 gem incentive for linking your player account.
If you’ve already linked your account, you’ll be rewarded the gems automatically!
Added a new behavior to delete entries in the Battle History. (See above for details.)
Added weekly free gem gift on the web store, in addition to the daily in game free gems.
Updated the in-game info for Guilds to include information about Token expiry and the gem conversion.

Fixed an issue where the Wall still occasionally allowed enemies to tunnel through.
Fixed an issue where the Nuke card shows an incorrect number of waves before recharging in the lab selection view.
Fixed an issue where Target Priority did not correctly target Protectors.
Fixed a visual bug in the Shatter screen displaying overlapping text when the shard quantity surpassed 1,000.

Fixed an issue where module substat text was not auto-adjusting its size in some languages.
Improved Leaderboard information to include Tiers 19, 20, and 21.
Fixed a bugged interaction where Scatter children did not interact correctly with the Commander’s buff radius.
v27.2.2 (December 1, 2025)
Hello Tower Defenders! We have a new build going out on Android shortly, with a full roll-out shortly after. Here is a look at the upcoming changes:
Lab Refactor
We have reworked our entire lab system! This change should address many outstanding lab issues, notably regarding offline lab speedup progress. This adjustment is fully internal and does not have any functionality or UI changes.
Orbital Augment Adjustments
The Orbital Augment module has been adjusted to specifically try and remove infinite runs:
Adds [2/4/6/8] orbiting Electrons around the tower. Each Electron deals damage equal to 15% of the enemy's remaining health (quarter effective against Bosses and Fleets)
What does this mean?
This change will stop players from using Orbital Augment as the sole means to kill enemies. However, it will also make the module way stronger against more enemy types. Let's walk through some examples of what this might look like for different enemy types:
Basics
(1x wave health): The first hit will deal 15% damage, the second 12.8%, and so on. Previously, it was 10% per hit. This new formula is stronger until 7 Electron hits
Tanks
(4x wave health): The new module works the exact same way for Tanks as it does for Basics. Previously, it was 2.5% per hit. This new formula is stronger until 40 Electron hits
Bosses
(20x wave health): The first hit will deal 3.75% damage, the second 3.6%, and so on. Previously, it was 0.5% per hit. This new formula is stronger until 200 Electron hits
In addition to the changes, we have also worked on a fix to the Electrons desyncing as a result of a longer game session. We have also added Electron Damage in the stats panel.
Fleets at Higher Waves
We are now adding fleets to all tiers. Tier 1 will have Fleets starting at wave 15,000, and each subsequent tier will have Fleets appear 250 waves earlier (T2 = 14,750, T3 = 14,500, etc). Once they appear, they will spawn every 100 waves.
We are continuing to develop systems that make the higher waves at each tier more challenging. There was a section in today's Monday Morning Announcement about TTG's stance on Infinite Runs. Additionally, in the next few updates, we will aim to improve tournament run length. We want to ensure it remains competitive and fun, while reducing its duration overall.
Changelog,
Implemented a lab refactor to resolve issues including offline research syncing,
Adjusted Orbital Augment’s description and gameplay:,
Adds [2/4/6/8] orbiting Electrons around the tower. Each Electron deals damage equal to 15% of the enemy's remaining health (quarter effective against Bosses and Fleets),
Fixed an issue where Electrons would desync over the course of a longer run,
Added Electron Damage to stats panel,
Added Fleets to all Tiers at higher waves,
Adjusted the Stone Pack offer to feature icons instead of text,
Fixed a UI issue where the “Game Paused” message overlaps in some menus,
Fixed a UI issue where the the Milestone Pass description did not indent into a new line, making the description too small,
Fixed an issue were enemy mass did not fit in the Info Panel screen,
Fixed an issue where the new Support panel unpauses a paused run,
Adjusted the date displays in Battle History and tournaments so it correctly localizes to the player’s region.
V27.3 Patch Notes - December 18, 2025,
Hello Tower Defenders! We are rolling out our last minor update of the year now on Android, with iOS rolling out within the next day. This build should be fully available to everyone tomorrow. Here’s a look at the changes:
New Toggles Menu,
We have added a new "Toggles" menu to replace our current "Hit Texts" button in the Settings. Some existing buttons, such as 120FPS and Cinematic of Idle have moved into this menu, while Sound and Music will remain in the Settings menu. Here is a look at our current list of toggles:
Added Auto Pause in Menus,
Added Stone Confirmation,
Turning off this toggle will remove the confirmation for stone purchases that costs 100 stones or more,
Added Gem Confirmations,
Same as Stones, but for Gem purchases equal to or greater than 200,
Added Ranged Enemy Shooting Line,
Added Show Cinematic Gems,
Added Brighter Spotlight,
Auto Restart has been removed from the end of round screen and added to this section for players who have unlocked this Vault upgrade,
Lab Improvements,
We have made some improvements to our Labs UI. To start, we made the lab sliders into actual sliders! Setting values has become easier, with an - and + symbol on either side to make incremental changes. Additionally, we've added a new Slider filter to the Research selection screen so you can see all labs that have sliders.
Additionally, we have fixed an issue where some longer researches were not ticking properly. This was a floating point number issue that was only apparently in some instances.
Tournament Adjustments,
We are adding two new permanent battle conditions to tournaments and adjusting our old Enemy Level Skip Reduction BC from all tournaments. Additionally, we are making tier scaling adjustments in Champions and Legends.
Let’s dive into the changes:
Skip Decay
Description: Enemy health and attack level skip chances are reduced by [VAL]% every [N] waves.
VAL starts at 1% and is the value that the generic Battle Condition Reduction lab will impact.
N is the number of waves it takes between activations of the BC, and this is what the level of the BC will impact.
Finally, the level of the BC will change based on the tournament league and not increase in strength during the run, similar to how More Bosses works.
Legends: Level 80 => Every 20 waves, lose 1% from ELS,
Champion: Level 60 => Every 40 waves, lose 1% from ELS,
Platinum: Level 40 => Every 60 waves, lose 1% from ELS,
Gold: Level 20 => Every 80 waves, lose 1% from ELS,
Skip Reduction - Multiply
Description: Enemy health and attack level skip chances are multiplied by x.[VAL],
This new Battle Condition will be impacted by the existing Enemy Level Skip Reduction Lab (which has been renamed to Skip Reduction Lab).
VAL is impacted by both BC labs (generic and specific) and is tied to the level of the Battle Condition:
Legends: Level 55 => multiplied by x0.45,
Champion: Level 40 => multiplied by x0.6,
Platinum: Level 25 => multiplied by x0.75,
Gold: Level 10 => multiplied by x0.9,
Removing Enemy Level Skip Reduction,
The previous ELS Reduction BC has been rebranded to Skip Reduction - Subtract. It has been removed from all tournaments. It will remain untouched on the normal tiers it was already a Battle Condition for. The Skip Reduction lab will still impact this Battle Condition
Tier Scaling,
Finally, we are changing the tier scaling in the Champions and Legends league. The tier scaling will change from [1/3/5/8/11/14] to [1/3/5/8/12/17]
Changelog,
Gameplay
Added one more Card slots that cost gems (10,000),
To avoid future Wall tunneling issues, the tower is now immune to all damage except from Vampires while the Wall is active,
Enemy Level Skip Reduction has been renamed to Skip Reduction. In addition, it's impact on stats will now be visible in the utility workshop tab during a run.,
Added functionality for Second Wind to spawn the Wall, invulnerable while the Second Wind timer is active,
Added a 15 second period of invulnerability to Nuke activation,
Changed the behavior of the Damage Reduction node in the Vault to not be applied while Intro Sprint is active,
Improved behavior of Critical Coin Card so it always applies to Black Hole and Thorns,
Increase the number of Fleets for ending long runs (one additional Fleet every 1000 waves after first wave instance),
When Fleets are introduced at later waves, only one Fleet will drop rewards in that wave even if multiple Fleets are present,
All 3 enhancement discount labs have had their formula changed from cost / (1 + %) to cost * (1 - %),
Primordial Collapse no longer provides double benefit on the Wall and projectiles,
UI,
Added the functionality for players to hide pop-up confirmations for the rest of the session,
Added a Pulsar Harvester stat to the Boss Breakdown that displays the amount of Level reduction applied instead of only the damage dealt,
Change "End Round" button in the in-run menu to "Exit Battle", adjusted pop-up messaging,
Added functionality for all menus to be viewable (but unchangeable) while mid run,
The boss stats menu will now always show the health (and subsequent stats) of the most recently spawned boss.,
Improved visual positioning of Card description in the Card selection screen,
Other Changes,
Rewrote the Golden Tower VFX from scratch to improve performance,
Add behavior for unclaimed Guild rewards to be mailed to your inventory,
Added the Support button to the Login panel,
Bugfixes,
Fixed an issue where notifications for tournament do not show up,
Fixed an issue where your Tournament ranking displays wrong rank in reward declaration,
Fixed an issue where the "Pick a Perk" prompt persists when perks are still exhausted,
Fixed an unintended interaction with Pulsar Harvester and Orbital Augment, where equipping both OA and PH would reduce the damage of OA unintentionally,
Fixed a visual issue where the Lab notification bubble appears before a player has unlocked Lab,
Holiday Featured Module Banners,
We are excited to share that for the next month, we will be doing featured module banners for each module type! Each week, we will be featuring one module type (like Cannon), and increase the drop rates for all Epic modules of that type. Here’s the timeline:
December 21, 2025 4:00 PM to December 28, 2025 3:59 PM will feature Epic Core Modules
December 28, 2025 4:00 PM to January 4, 2026 3:59 PM will feature Epic Cannon Modules

Major Update - Guilds - v26.0
Hello everyone!
We’ve got a new major version rolling tomorrow 3/3 at 10 AM CST, and will hopefully finish its rollout by the end of the day (following morning if we have to fix some things). There is a lot of new content, updates, and bug fixes, so let’s dive in.
Guilds
Guilds are coming to The Tower! Players can create their own Guild or join up to 29 other players in an existing Guild formed by someone else.
Design Goal: Guilds were built with the game’s existing complexity in mind. We don’t want to add a super complex, chore based layer to the game with how much is already in the game. We also were very cognizant to design the reward structure to avoid super guilds of players that only pay, play a lot or are super powerful
Rewards are fairly light and are earned by playing mostly how you would have played The Tower anyway. There’s no need to chat with your guild to get a lot out of the mechanic. I don’t want players to feel obligated to glue themselves to a new mechanic of the game endlessly, and only want something that’s going to bring more fun to the game.
Lastly, with it being fairly light, it serves as a foundation for us to add more fun modes within it in time, but that’s to come later. We will be reviewing how the system is interacted with and reading a lot of feedback to help guide us towards growing the system.
Chat within your guild to help develop your own custom tower strategies.
Claim Weekly Challenge boxes to earn Guild Tokens that you can spend but also count towards your guild’s earnings for the week.
Throughout the week, claim up to 4 Guild Chests your Guild has worked together to earn
The new reward from Guild Chests are Guardian Bits! Guardian Bits can be spent on upgrading your new Guardian
Guardians are the newest support system for your tower. Different chips can be equipped to empower your guardian in unique ways, and new skins will allow you to personalize the guardian to suit your tower.
Guild Tokens can be spent on new cosmetics and personalization for your game, profile, and tower
Unspent Guild Tokens will be auto cashed out at the end of each Guild Season (8 weeks)
Game Updates
Cloud Save
The backend for cloud saves has been completely migrated to a new system. This should drastically reduce several cloud save bugs that have been experienced on and off in the past. Upon updating, players will need to log in to their account, but there should be no other noticeable changes for players. Finally, player devices will need to be connected to the internet to start the app, but they can continue runs offline once they have started playing.
Player Profile
The player profile has been expanded to include guild icon and guild name. Additionally, there are personalized main menu and profile banners skins that will be available in the guild store.
Event Updates
The Event Boost has been changed to include two new Premium relics. Every event players will continue to be able earn the two Relics for getting 350 and 700 medals from a single event. For those that buy the Event Boost, they can also earn an additional Epic and Rare relic.
These relics will be rotated into events and/or guilds for purchase with currency if missed, eventually
Enemy Level Skips
Both Enemy Attack Level Skip and Enemy Health Level Skip have been changed to be completely non random. For example: A 50% chance will skip every other wave with no variance.
Vault Expansion
Both vault trees have been expanded with multiple new enhancements. The Power Tree’s expansion allows various nodes to be upgraded a second (or even third!) time.
Tier 2 is unlockable once you have unlocked 15 Tier 1 Power Tree Nodes.
Tier 3 is unlockable once you have unlocked 25 Tier 1 Power Tree Nodes and 15 Tier 2 Power Tree Nodes
Both of these upgrades have a one time purchases associated with them
Modules
New modules have been added to the game.
Design Goal: Don’t fear about them muddying the current pool of modules you are searching for already. We’ve added a way to focus on finding these new modules (as well as older modules as they rotate into the new banner system)
We currently have 4 new modules coming, but they will be introduced over time and will rotate into the banner system, with one new one available at update time
We’ve also used this chance to improve a lot of the module system
Now there are two module banners to choose - the featured and the standard. Standard is the same as before, while the Featured Banner will have a specific Module highlighted.
Gems spent on the featured banner will have a much higher chance of resulting in the highlighted module.
Any time a module is featured, it will have two weeks as a focus.
Currently, new modules can only be obtained through the featured banner, but they will be added to the standard banner later.
Any module that you already have at Ancestral (5 Stars) will have a substantially lower chance to appear.
Once you have a module at Ancestral (5 Stars), you can shatter other modules with that exact effect to get shards
Additionally:
It is now guaranteed to get at least 1 rare module every 10 pulls
Module history allows players to see up to 150 of their previous pulls
The module cap has been extended to level 300 (this requires a module to be at Ancestral - 5 stars)
New module substats can be unlocked at level 201 and 241
The shard cost of module levels between 161 and 200 has been slightly reduced
Ultimate Weapons
Poison Swamp has been reworked to be much stronger, but on a Cooldown system rather than a Chance %.
Damage stat has been increased
Base radius has increased
Poisoned enemies move 25% slower
Poison Swamp Stun duration, Stun chance, and Swamp Radius labs have been made stronger and have had 5 levels added
Inner Land Mine’s damage stats have been massively increased.
Inner Land Mine - Chrono Jump (ILM+ required) is a new lab that will add to the charge of an ILM for each ILM the enemy has been hit by
Spotlight has had 15 levels added to Angle. If this stat is maxed, the Spotlight Angle module effect for Core Modules will be banned for free.
If a player has maxed the Chrono Field Duration workshop stat as well as the Duration lab, the Chrono Field Duration module effect for Core Modules will be banned for free.
Death Wave has been given 5 additional levels to CD.
Every Ultimate Weapon+ had levels added to them
Other changes
Wall Rebuild will now push all enemies out from the tower to ensure no enemies are trapped inside.
Count of Active Enemies has been added to the Wave Info tab
Battle Condition Reduction lab (T18W1000) - Decreases the level of the active battle conditions by a percentage (does not apply to the More Bosses or UW duration BCs)
A new permanent Battle Condition has been added to the Legends League tournament - Enemy Level Skip Reduction.

v0.25.0 - Legends Update
Card Mastery
After years of research, our top scientists have finally made a breakthrough in the card system. Each card has a unique “Mastery” that can be unlocked using stones. This Mastery will add an immediate benefit to your card, and it will unlock a new lab that will let you level up the effect even more. These new upgrades are very expensive but will allow for a wider variety of strategies. Card Mastery can be accessed once the milestone for T16W100 is claimed and a player owns all copies of every card.
Interface Improvements
Lab Screen
Search has been added to the labs
History tab has been added to the labs (it will not contain labs researched before v25)
Lab sections can be collapsed
Individual labs can be favorited
Favorited labs show up even if they are complete
The number of levels in the lab can be seen on the Lab Info panel
A new toggle exists to auto research labs. If you have enough coins to research the next level, it will automatically start once the previous level finishes.
Labs with partial progress will have their time remaining highlighted in green
Labs with an adjustable level have a slightly more intuitive UX
Labs with at least 1 level researched will stay visible - even if the underlying mechanic is lost (through respec)
Resume Round

The 10 wave limit for resumes has been removed

You can now close out of the Resume Round pop up without losing your run (various screens will be locked)

Miscellaneous
Added a new “Cinematic Mode” that removes all the elements from the UI except the tower. It can be toggled on in the Settings Menu. Cinematic mode can also be manually activated by pinching the screen during a round. What a beautiful screensaver!
The full info panels for Ultimate Weapons and Bots now show the value of the next level.
In many out-of-round views, a dropdown arrow has been added to the header that will show a list of all current currencies
Tournament Changes
We have heard all the feedback about tournaments and made several small changes that will hopefully fix many of the existing problems - without changing how players think about tournaments.
We have added a Legends league (T14+)
We have changed the rewards for almost every rank such that doing better will always net more (or the same amount) of stones. To do this some individual ranks were lowered, but it is an explicit increase in stones - especially with Legends expanding the ceiling.
Copper and Silver are now “protected” tiers. Once a player is promoted out of them, they can never be demoted back into them.
The Boss Bottle Condition is permanent (without heat up) in all leagues. 1 boss for every 10 waves in Copper, 1 boss for every 9 waves in Silver, … , 1 boss for every 5 waves in Legends
The Death Defy OR Energy Shield Battle Condition is permanent for all leagues Platinum and up
Battle Conditions have been adjusted such that there is 1 in Silver, 2 in Gold, 3 in Platinum, 4 in Champion, and 5 in Legends. This does not count the previous two special exceptions for tournament Battle Conditions.
The limit on boss drops of Modules and Reroll dice have been removed
Ties will give both players the better reward
Only the top 4 players in a bracket will be promoted. Only the bottom 6 will be demoted.
Tournament relics have been changed to reflect the new tournament league. Existing relics will be grandfathered in.
Tournament tickets will now start to increase in price after the first one is purchased with gems
Unclaimed tournament rewards will be mailed to players after the window to claim ends (this includes corresponding promotion and demotion)
Tournaments will extend for an additional 4 hours past the time to join a bracket. This time will allow for players to finish any active runs, but they will not be able to join a new bracket or start a new run.
Legends introduces a new currency: Keys. Keys can be used in a one of two new upgrade tree - Power (tower related buffs) and Harmony (non tower related buffs and QoL)
The Vault (where the above trees are located) is hidden until a player obtains at least one key.
Other changes
Daily Reward boxes have a level 30 and level 35 added
New missions have been added to the pool
The first day of the event will now always have 7 missions (5 set + 2 random)

Feature Adjustments
6x lab boost has been added as a lab speed up option
The cost of lab speed ups is no longer increased by 20% for every other lab being boosted. To account for this, the cost of boosting a lab 3x and higher has been raised to the average cost of running all 5 labs (net neutral). The cost of boosting a lab 2x has been increased a lesser amount (slight buff). The cost of boosting a lab 1.5x has not been increased (buff).

Bot revamp
Bots have been redesigned so that their timing is more intuitive. They now work the same way as Ultimate Weapons, and they can be toggled on/off during a run. Additionally, new stats and labs have been added so that your bots can get even stronger! New Stats:
For all 4 bots, the stat ‘Frequency’ has been changed to ‘Cooldown’. Medal purchases into frequency will be refunded. Lab levels that were researched will persist.
Golden Bot - Duration
Amplify Bot - Duration
Thunder Bot - Linger%: A portion of the stun effect will remain for 3 seconds even after the thunder bot's duration
Flame Bot - Damage Reduction%: Enemies burned by Flame Bot will have a portion of their damage reduced
Labs:
Golden Bot - Increase duration
Amplify Bot - Increase duration
Thunder Bot - Increase linger time
Flame Bot - Burn Stack: Allow for successive hits to stack the burn effect
Additionally the renamed Cooldown lab (was Frequency) for all 4 Bots has been given 5 additional levels
Other:
Flame Bot now “burns” the enemy. Every second, a burned enemy takes damage equal to Flame Bot initial hit, burn stacks (allowed with the lab), makes the burn ticks faster per stack, for example a stack of 4 will make the enemy take a burn hit every 0.25s (1s/4)
Thunder Bot is now 50% effective against Bosses and Elites. Linger % is also 50% effective against Bosses and Elites.
Ultimate Weapon Improvements
We have adjusted every UW in some way. There are plenty of new upgrades to spend stones on, and several existing upgrades have been made stronger or changed to fit the game better.
Chain Lightning - Damage Scaling Changed
Chain Lightning - CL+ reworked (the new effect is capped after 100 hits on a given enemy)
Chain Lightning - Damage module substats have had their scaling changed
Smart Missiles - Damage Scaling Changed
Smart Missiles - New levels added to Cooldown and Quantity

Chrono Field - CF+ reworked
Golden Tower - New levels added to Duration and Bonus
Golden Tower - GT+ only counts enemies that spawned during the current activation
Poison Swamp - New levels added to Duration
Black Hole - New levels added to Duration
Black Hole - BH+ reworked
Spotlight - New levels added to Angle and Quantity
Spotlight - SL+ reworked
Labs:
Chain Thunder: Every 1% of enemy health removed by chain lightning reduces enemy damage by 10% (max reduction: [lab level])
Lightning Amplifier ~ Scatter: Each Chain Lightning hit on a Scatter will amplify the damage for the next Chain Lightning hit on the same target (Additive)
Swamp Rend: When Basic Enemies are hurt by the Poison Swamp, that damage is boosted by a percent of the enemy’s current Rend Armor Mult
Swamp Rend - Additional Enemies: Increase the type of enemies that are impacted by Swamp Rend
Spawn rate & FPS improvements
Here's the big one! A large part of the game code has been rewritten to be lighter on compute. The main tangible effect is: when lag starts to happen, the game can now recover gracefully. Previously, this would just snowball and cause all new computation to lag. Spawn rate differences across game speeds have been resolved.
Tier 16, 17, 18
Three new tiers with all new Battle Conditions have been added. Additionally, the scaling of Battle Condition levels from T14 and T15 has been lessened, so that they are more gradually increased to T18. The damage and health scaling of enemies T14+ has been decreased.

Auto Perk Priority
Perk Ban (4 more levels)

Wave Skip now works on all waves (including xxx9)

v0.24.3
Death Wave Rework
Death Wave has been completely reworked. It should still provide many of the benefits of today while adding many more. It works on the same Cooldown as the old Death Wave. Now, however, there is only one damage dealing wave (called the Death Wave). The Death Wave has a "damage pool" and will persist at your tower range until it has dealt that amount of damage. New activations of DW will add to the damage pool (rather than replacing it). The "damage pool" will only be reduced by the amount of damage needed to destroy an enemy (factoring in any bonuses)
The Death Wave is preceded by some number of Effect Waves.
“Quantity” has been changed to “Effect Waves”
Effect Waves have 5 utilities (all of which can be improved with labs):
Coin bonus: An enemy hit by an Effect Wave or the final Death Wave will have a coin bonus when it is destroyed
Health bonus: An enemy hit by an Effect Wave or the final Death Wave will give a 0.05% health bonus when it is destroyed
Cell bonus: An elite enemy hit by an Effect Wave or the final Death Wave will have a cell bonus applied when it is destroyed
Death Wave Damage Amplifier: Each Effect Wave hit on a given enemy will boost the damage that enemy takes from the Death Wave
Death Wave Armor Stripping: Each Effect Wave hit will strip some amount of armor from an enemy
Effect Waves range are infinite
Effect Waves have a 4 second interval
Damage Scaling has been adjusted
Damage module substat has been drastically improved
Kill Wall drastically increases the damage of the Death Wave by counting every enemy hit by an effect wave and boosting the damage by that number times the power of your Kill Wall
The Random Ultimate Weapon perk version of Death Wave will have the base health bonus and damage amplification bonus.
Other Changes
New Enemy Battle Conditions added (Fast, Ranged, Basic, Boss)
All Enemy Battle Conditions also get “boss status”: not impacted by orbs, Death Ray, Black Hole, or Black Hole damage. 50% damage from thorns
Bonus from Death Wave in the Health tooltip is now shown as a multiplier rather than a magnitude
Damage / Meter has been correctly adjusted to being based on 1 meter rather than 10 meters
Damage / Meter module substats have been increased
Rays and Vampires are now affected by CF+

Bot range scales more smoothly and generously based on tower range
Thunder, Chrono Field Reduction %, and Flame bot damage reduction all work on Rays
Black Hole position is now slightly inside range at any tower range
Plasma Cannon now fires before Boss get in range
Bug Fixes
iOS occasionally being unable to connect to the internet for tournaments should be fixed
Thorns Battle Condition was not affecting Rays
Thorns hit text unlocks correctly
Enemies were stopping a little short of the tower hitbox
Updated Flame Bot Description
Flame Bot armor stripping works now (lab copy has changed to match)

v0.23 - Invaders Update
Elite enemies from another galaxy are invading the Tower territory! These mysterious enemies of triangle shape show up in all tiers. Their chances of appearing will increase more and more as you progress to higher waves.
New Enemies
There are 3 types of Elite enemies:
Vampire:
Vampires drain Tower health constantly while they are in range. Wall and Energy Shield do not prevent this effect. While a Vampire drains the Tower, both Health Regen and Lifesteal are disabled. Vampires have high knockback resistance and drain doesn't activate thorns.
Scatter:
Scatter will split into smaller versions of itself when defeated. The smaller versions will then split again. Scatters have high knockback resistance.
Ray
Once Ray reaches Tower range, it will charge for a time before firing a powerful ray at the Tower. Rays are completely immune to knockback.
All Elite enemies are immune to orbs, Death Ray, Shockwave, and Black Hole. When defeated, Elite enemies will drop
Elite Cells
. You will be able to use these cells to SPEED UP LABS!
Elite Cells and Lab Boosts
Lab Speed Up Elite Cells are used to activate a boost for lab slots to make them work faster, increasing their rate by up to 5x speed for up to 24 hours. The Elite Cell cost per boost increases with higher speed, duration, and number of labs being boosted.
Workshop Enhancements
To help repel these invaders, a lab research has been added to unlock workshop enhancements. This new panel offers various upgrades with percentage increases! The more coins you invest in enhancements, the more upgrade options will become available.
New Features
Two new slots added to active cards.
New epic card Nuke, when activated will kill onscreen enemies. Can be used at any time (similar to Demon Mode).
New labs to recharge limited-use abilities after a number of waves: Second Wind, Demon Mode, Missile Barrage and the new Nuke.
Wall Fortification lab added that allows Health Regen to increase Wall Health beyond its maximum value.
Added ability to reroll daily missions (lab research to unlock).
Modules Additions and Changes
After you stop rerolling module sub effects, a new panel will show up asking if you want to keep the new effects or rollback to the effects that you had at the start (reroll shards used will be spent either way).
Modules can be marked as favorites now. These modules will show up first in inventory, can't be selected as fodder on merge, can't be shattered, and are completely ignored by auto merge (do manual merge or unfavorite it to use auto merge).
Modules can be unmerged (lab research to unlock). The fodder modules will be converted to shards.
Equipped modules will be visible on the player's profile.
Fixed Astral Deliverance not applying bounce extra damage.

Features
Events: participate in 2 week events. Accomplish missions to earn event currency. Spend currency on gems/stones, permanent upgrades to your tower in the form of robotic companions, or limited time themes. After an event completes, a new one will be ready in 2 weeks (usually). See in game info panel for more info. Expect changes to this along the way as I receive feedback
Bots: Earned through events, fly around your tower causing damage, stunning or providing coin bonuses. Can be upgraded further after unlocking
Themes: Each event will feature a limited theme that can be unlocked by earning event currency. Change the look of your tower and the background theme
Tournaments
• New league: Champion - tier 10+ (this adds more granularity to leagues and will disperse skill levels better to create a more gradual difficulty gap between leagues). Expect more changes shortly after though once players start filtering into new leagues

Balance
Waves starting at roughly wave 60 and above will have higher scaling for difficulty to end rounds a bit earlier (more health, slightly faster spawn rate, slightly higher chance of tanks and fast enemies). The general reason for this is to shorten rounds across the board as it was never designed to run for an hour plus. It will also help balance defensive builds as below, expect more changes though
Scaling of attack damage of enemies reduced to help make defensive builds better
Tier's difficulty spread out a wee bit more making higher tiers more difficult
Health upgrade scaling buffed considerably
