List of Lab Upgrades
Description
The upgrades that can be bought in the lab, that help with scaling, or max caps. Most labs will be unlocked in
Milestones
before you can research them.
Features of Research
The labs page has a few features that affect research or are QoL improvements.
Switching labs:
When currently researching a lab, a player can click the lab and change to a different research. Coins used for the lab are refunded and progress on the lab is preserved and displayed as a green lab time. When continuing that research, the coins will need to be paid again.
Auto Research:
When looking at the labs there is a small clock/timer icon to the left of the progress bar. Enabling this button will have the lab start researching there next level of current lab, once the current research is finished.
Lab Search:
When selecting a new lab, a player can type the name of a lab in the search bar to pull up related labs without scrolling.
Lab History:
When selecting a new  lab, a user can click the History Tab to see a list of labs completed chronologically and the date/time they were completed.
Number of Labs
You will start with one lab when unlocked in Milestones at tier 1 wave 30. You can unlock up to 5 labs. The total cost is 4,900 gems.

Rushing Labs
You can skip lab time by spending gems. When rushing labs, you can only skip the entire remaining lab time. Longer lab times have built in discounts making it cost less gems per time. When you gold box labs, it increases your gem rush efficiency, making gem rushing more powerful (less gems needed to rush). Each fully gold-boxed lab increases the efficiency of gems by 0.015x (additively).
Credit to Shantymatic for calculations (Outdated due to gem rush efficiency update)

Boosting Labs
Labs can be boosted using
Elite Cells
.  Labs can be sped up by 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x and 8x for 1 hour, 8 hours or 24 hours. The way that you do this is as follows: select "Speed Up" in the lab, choose the duration (1, 8, or 24 hours), then choose the multiplier (1.5x through 8x). Once both are selected, the lab shows you the cost in Elite Cells for that boost. All lab boosts cost a flat rate since v25.5.
The cost of boosting goes up faster than the boost multiplier, for example 1.5x to 2x is a 50% base or a ~33% relative increase vs a 6.67 times cost increase. Thus it is advisable to boost multiple labs at the same time instead of boosting at higher multipliers unless you have the cell generation to replenish the cost before the time runs out. For example, seven 1.5x boosts at a 1 hour duration (equal to 105 cells) is 3.5 hours of research time being skipped, while a single 2x boost at a 1 hour duration (100 cells) only skips 1 hour of research time.
Lab Boosts can be set up to automatically queue when completed. This is done with the "Speed Up" Button and the multiplier and duration can be setup within the menu. Additionally, lab speed ups only tick while a lab is slotted for research.
