Major Update - Guilds - v26.0
Hello everyone!
We’ve got a new major version rolling tomorrow 3/3 at 10 AM CST, and will hopefully finish its rollout by the end of the day (following morning if we have to fix some things). There is a lot of new content, updates, and bug fixes, so let’s dive in.
Guilds
Guilds are coming to The Tower! Players can create their own Guild or join up to 29 other players in an existing Guild formed by someone else.
Design Goal: Guilds were built with the game’s existing complexity in mind. We don’t want to add a super complex, chore based layer to the game with how much is already in the game. We also were very cognizant to design the reward structure to avoid super guilds of players that only pay, play a lot or are super powerful
Rewards are fairly light and are earned by playing mostly how you would have played The Tower anyway. There’s no need to chat with your guild to get a lot out of the mechanic. I don’t want players to feel obligated to glue themselves to a new mechanic of the game endlessly, and only want something that’s going to bring more fun to the game.
Lastly, with it being fairly light, it serves as a foundation for us to add more fun modes within it in time, but that’s to come later. We will be reviewing how the system is interacted with and reading a lot of feedback to help guide us towards growing the system.
Chat within your guild to help develop your own custom tower strategies.
Claim Weekly Challenge boxes to earn Guild Tokens that you can spend but also count towards your guild’s earnings for the week.
Throughout the week, claim up to 4 Guild Chests your Guild has worked together to earn
The new reward from Guild Chests are Guardian Bits! Guardian Bits can be spent on upgrading your new Guardian
Guardians are the newest support system for your tower. Different chips can be equipped to empower your guardian in unique ways, and new skins will allow you to personalize the guardian to suit your tower.
Guild Tokens can be spent on new cosmetics and personalization for your game, profile, and tower
Unspent Guild Tokens will be auto cashed out at the end of each Guild Season (8 weeks)
Game Updates
Cloud Save
The backend for cloud saves has been completely migrated to a new system. This should drastically reduce several cloud save bugs that have been experienced on and off in the past. Upon updating, players will need to log in to their account, but there should be no other noticeable changes for players. Finally, player devices will need to be connected to the internet to start the app, but they can continue runs offline once they have started playing.
Player Profile
The player profile has been expanded to include guild icon and guild name. Additionally, there are personalized main menu and profile banners skins that will be available in the guild store.
Event Updates
The Event Boost has been changed to include two new Premium relics. Every event players will continue to be able earn the two Relics for getting 350 and 700 medals from a single event. For those that buy the Event Boost, they can also earn an additional Epic and Rare relic.
These relics will be rotated into events and/or guilds for purchase with currency if missed, eventually
Enemy Level Skips
Both Enemy Attack Level Skip and Enemy Health Level Skip have been changed to be completely non random. For example: A 50% chance will skip every other wave with no variance.
Vault Expansion
Both vault trees have been expanded with multiple new enhancements. The Power Tree’s expansion allows various nodes to be upgraded a second (or even third!) time.
Tier 2 is unlockable once you have unlocked 15 Tier 1 Power Tree Nodes.
Tier 3 is unlockable once you have unlocked 25 Tier 1 Power Tree Nodes and 15 Tier 2 Power Tree Nodes
Both of these upgrades have a one time purchases associated with them
Modules
New modules have been added to the game.
Design Goal: Don’t fear about them muddying the current pool of modules you are searching for already. We’ve added a way to focus on finding these new modules (as well as older modules as they rotate into the new banner system)
We currently have 4 new modules coming, but they will be introduced over time and will rotate into the banner system, with one new one available at update time
We’ve also used this chance to improve a lot of the module system
Now there are two module banners to choose - the featured and the standard. Standard is the same as before, while the Featured Banner will have a specific Module highlighted.
Gems spent on the featured banner will have a much higher chance of resulting in the highlighted module.
Any time a module is featured, it will have two weeks as a focus.
Currently, new modules can only be obtained through the featured banner, but they will be added to the standard banner later.
Any module that you already have at Ancestral (5 Stars) will have a substantially lower chance to appear.
Once you have a module at Ancestral (5 Stars), you can shatter other modules with that exact effect to get shards
Additionally:
It is now guaranteed to get at least 1 rare module every 10 pulls
Module history allows players to see up to 150 of their previous pulls
The module cap has been extended to level 300 (this requires a module to be at Ancestral - 5 stars)
New module substats can be unlocked at level 201 and 241
The shard cost of module levels between 161 and 200 has been slightly reduced
Ultimate Weapons
Poison Swamp has been reworked to be much stronger, but on a Cooldown system rather than a Chance %.
Damage stat has been increased
Base radius has increased
Poisoned enemies move 25% slower
Poison Swamp Stun duration, Stun chance, and Swamp Radius labs have been made stronger and have had 5 levels added
Inner Land Mine’s damage stats have been massively increased.
Inner Land Mine - Chrono Jump (ILM+ required) is a new lab that will add to the charge of an ILM for each ILM the enemy has been hit by
Spotlight has had 15 levels added to Angle. If this stat is maxed, the Spotlight Angle module effect for Core Modules will be banned for free.
If a player has maxed the Chrono Field Duration workshop stat as well as the Duration lab, the Chrono Field Duration module effect for Core Modules will be banned for free.
Death Wave has been given 5 additional levels to CD.
Every Ultimate Weapon+ had levels added to them
Other changes
Wall Rebuild will now push all enemies out from the tower to ensure no enemies are trapped inside.
Count of Active Enemies has been added to the Wave Info tab
Battle Condition Reduction lab (T18W1000) - Decreases the level of the active battle conditions by a percentage (does not apply to the More Bosses or UW duration BCs)
A new permanent Battle Condition has been added to the Legends League tournament - Enemy Level Skip Reduction.

Ending a run offline should no longer occasionally put the tower into a locked state
