The Nuke
card
requires manual activation. Use it to destroy groups of dangerous enemies like
Elites
and
Fleets
before they can overwhelm your tower.
With
Smart Nuke Automation
, it is one of several abilities that prevent death, activating in the following order where possible:
Death Defy
: If lethal damage would be taken, Death Defy may activate instead.
Energy Shield
: If
any
damage would be taken and Death Defy did not activate, Energy Shield will expend a charge instead.
Second Wind
: If lethal damage would be taken and no higher-priority death prevention is available, Second Wind will activate instead.
Demon Mode
: With
Smart Demon Mode Automation
, if lethal damage would be taken and no higher-priority death prevention is available, Demon Mode will activate instead.
Nuke: With Smart Nuke Automation, if lethal damage would be taken and no higher-priority death prevention is available, Nuke will activate instead. This does not destroy in-flight projectiles, but as of
v27.3 (18 Dec, 2025)
