Themes
will rotate each event. Themes are available for a limited time and can be missed. Themes have returned in the past but there is no certainty a theme will return in the future. Once purchased, theme will be available for use forever. There will be 1 tower theme available for 150 medals and 1 background for 250 medals.
Relics
For example, on  2024-09-16, had relics for purchase with medals for this
"Event – Volcano."
The relics are at the price-points of 200 and 500 medals. The relics are also designated as
'limited,'
so they may be unique to the event that sponsors them.
Relics are also earned for completing events. Earning 350 medals unlocks the first-tier Relic. Earning 700 medals unlocks the second (and final) tier Relic. Purchasing the event pass unlocks access to 2 extra relics, one at 550 medals and another at 1100 medals.
Songs
There are 3 songs available. These songs do not cycle and cost 200 medals each. Each one provides a +0.6% coin bonus.
Bots
Bots can only be purchased exclusively with medals in the event shop. Bots purchased will not reset each event. The shop offers 4 bots:
Flame
Thunder
Golden
Amplify
. The cost to unlock bots increases each time a bot is purchased.
Bots can be turned off and on in the shop between rounds.
