Health (midgame)
Buy health. Keep buying health. No matter how expensive the cash and coin cost gets, buy all the health. Don't forget the health lab research.
Primary mechanisms of destruction:
Thorns, should be topped off.
You should have orb speed maxed, as well.
Shockwave to push enemies into orbs.
Equip Inner Orbs and Death Ray if you have it.
Must-have Cards:
Health
Coins
Extra Defense
Free Upgrades
Optional Cards:
Slow aura and Range cards. Slower enemies, more likely to be hit by orbs.
Plasma Cannon and/or Energy Net. Goal is to ensure it take only one hit with thorns to kill a boss instead of two.
Perks to Go For:

End-game Gigachadery (When Health is Maxed):
Throw on an Attack card, Crit Chance card, maybe a Super Tower, beef up Death Wave. To start going on the offensive? Heavens, no! To get more health! Make the game crash with how big you can get your health.
