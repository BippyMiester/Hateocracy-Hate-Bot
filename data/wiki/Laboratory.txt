Description
The in-game icon.
The laboratory, or short "the labs", is a place where you can buy upgrades (different than those of the Workshop). These upgrades consist of scaling upgrades, max cap upgrades and more.
Most importantly they use an additional currency: your time. Every lab upgrade has a coin cost, and a time that it takes to complete, occupying one lab for that duration. It is therefore advised to try to keep your labs running at all times as as you progress in the game there will come a point where coins are no longer the bottleneck to progress, but time and labs are.
Amount Of Labs
3 Different Lab States from top to bottom: Inactive, Active, Locked
The max amount of labs you can have is 5.

To get all 5 you have to pay 4900
