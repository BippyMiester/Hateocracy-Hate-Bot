Card Mastery
When 30
cards
are maxed and the player has unlocked the Card Mastery Milestone at Tier 16, Wave 100, Card Masteries are unlocked. Card Masteries can be individually unlocked on the cards page. A card must be equipped to have that mastery effect active. Unlocking a Card Mastery costs a varying amount of stones and unlocks that card's Mastery Labs.
